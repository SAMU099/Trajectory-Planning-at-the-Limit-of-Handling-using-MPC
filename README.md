## To launch the simulations, go to the 'Matlab Implementation' folder.

Launch ***kinematic_model.m*** to see the output for the Kinematic Bicycle Model.
Launch ***point_mass_model.m*** to see the output for the Point-Mass Model.

***gradientAngle.m*** and ***ovalTrackGeneration.m*** are functions supporting the creating of the reference oval track for the algorithm

In addition, to change the prediction horizon, just modify line 18 of both scripts.

Refer to the pdf file, to understand the full methodology.
